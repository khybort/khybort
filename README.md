<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Muhsin </h1>

Iâ€™m a software craftsperson who loves to be in the center of creating software that is providing value for humanity or makes companies make great profits or makes them efficient. I always think about creating an impact on existing circumstances. I identify myself as a problem solver who is not a specific tech fanatic. I apply the most optimum solution when and where necessary.

I have thirteen years of experience and worked for seven companies from start-ups to big enterprise companies. I have worked in the following industries; energy, cryptocurrency, travel, defense, mission-critical, government, and geographic information systems. I have worked on-site, remote and cross continent company environments. I have both experience in synchronous and asynchronous development environments.
